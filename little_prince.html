                As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.

                <!-- Underlined text -->
                <span class="underline">
                    I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>

                    It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. 
                </span>
                In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I 
                said to myself:

                <!-- Modified text -->
                <span class="modifyText">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: </span>

                <!-- Modified text -->
                <span class="modifyText">
                    "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here is his loyalty to a flower--the image of 
                    a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ."
                </span>

                And I felt him to be more fragile still.
                
                <!-- Underlined text -->
                <span class="underline">
                    I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of 
                    wind . . .
                </span>
