        <!-- Short bio -->
        <p>
            My name is Hannah Khamvanthong, and I am a senior Computer Science student at NC A&T State University, 
            graduating this December. After graduation, I am planning on working as either a software engineer, 
            software developer, game developer, or a data analyst. I might also attend grad school after graduation.
